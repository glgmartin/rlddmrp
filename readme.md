# Reinforcement Learning for DDMRP

A repo for reinforcement learning implementation of parameter control in the case of Demand Driven MRP (DDMRP) flow shops

## Project goals and overview

Efficiently controlling a DDMRP flowshop requires to dynamically adapt several parameters for each buffer. In order to make it easier for opartives, this research works aims to leverage the help of reinforcement learning agents.
